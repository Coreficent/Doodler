Hello there!

How to Run the App:

The Main.java is the start of the app. After the app is compiled, the user can see the primary interface.

I use android studio, so I would click "run app", select Nexus 5 API 23 x86 as my emulator, click "ok". Wait a bit and the emulator should launch the app.

The primary interface has the following interactions:

The drawing canvas covers the majority of the interface. This is where the user can draw strokes by touching the canvas.

There is a brush button that allows the user to go to the secondary interface to edit the color, the size, and the opacity of the of the brush. The user may click the set brush button to go back to the primary interface after the user completes the settings of the brush.

The invert button allows the user to invert the color drawn on the canvas.

The clear button clears the canvas.

There are also the < button and > button, which stand for undo and redo. The user may undo and redo the drawing on the screen after the user draws some things on the canvas.

This application is written from scratch. Some of the techniques, such as the sliding screen, are learned from http://developer.android.com and http://youtube.com. All the rest is learned from the calculator example and the doodle example.
